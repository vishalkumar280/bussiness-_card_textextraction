AI OCR  FOR BUSINESS CARD DATA EXTRACTION

Overview
This project aims to create a reliable system that can extract organization and person names from business card images. The system is designed to handle various image qualities, including different resolutions, lighting conditions, and orientations. By utilizing OCR models such as PaddleOCR, this project provides a functional solution with a simple and intuitive interface for users.

FEATURES

Image Quality Handling: The system is capable of processing a variety of business card images, regardless of design, font, or quality.
OCR with PaddleOCR: Utilizes PaddleOCR to achieve a high accuracy rate of 84.4% in text extraction.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Employs spaCy NER to identify and categorize organization and person names from the extracted text.

Flask Integration: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask to interact with the system.

PROJECT STRUCTURE

Image Acquisition: Collecting a diverse set of business card images to form the projectâ€™s database.

OCR Model Initialization: Setting up and configuring PaddleOCR for text extraction.

Text Extraction: Extracting text from images using PaddleOCR and consolidating it into a single string.

NER Model Training: Training a spaCy model for organization and person name recognition using custom datasets.

UI Creation: Building a simple UI with Flask, HTML, and CSS to display the extracted information.

Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling for issues in text extraction and file writing.
